        <h1>Xavier Bouray</h1>
        <h2>DM Helpdesk Associate</h2>

        <p>I grew up in a small town in North Central Kansas called Beloit, with a population of less than <em>4000</em> people. Went through our public school system and graduated with a class of less than 30 people. After graduation I started working at the local tire store Thompson OK Tire, where I picked up many skills including but not limited to changing a car tire.</p>

        <p>I went to Fort Hays State Univirsity in August of 2013. I started school entertaining the idea of going into technology and with physics. I quickly learned this is not what I wanted out of college and changed my studies to Computer Science.</p><img src="images/FHSU_Logo.png">
        <p>Learning to create websites using HTML host them on Fort Hays' on campus server space and web-based hosting, to creating simple programs that collected entered data to a database was very rewarding and opened up my eyes to what computers and automation could proform.</p>
